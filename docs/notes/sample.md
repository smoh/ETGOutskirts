## Zhu, Blanton & Moustakas 2010
Sample
- parent sample: NYU-VAGC(all galaxies in SDSS with z<0.05) DR6 version 77,149 + RC3(galaxeis in SDSS imaging but without spectroscopy) 10,474
- red sequence: luminosity-dependent color cut (includes blue ellipticals) 37,026
    * 32,726 with SDSS spec
- preselect spheroidals:
    * "bulge + disk" model fitting of 1D surface brightness profile
    * B/(B+D) > 0.7 and ellipticity < 0.6
    * "featurelessness": ?
    * velocity dispersion > 70 km/s considering SDSS instrumental dispersion (22,621/32,726)
    * left with 2648
- visual inspection to rule out contaminants including
    * bulge-dominated SB0
    * galaxies with faint dust lanes
    * S0 with weak spiral structure
- final sample: 1923 with velocity dispersion > 70 km/s + 430 without SDSS spec

## Bernardi+13
Bayesian Automated morhpological classifier (Huertas-Company+11)

Nair & Abraham 2010 provides visual morph classification 0.01 < z < 0.1


## Experiment following Zhu+10
Parent sample: NSA catalog 145,155
- red sequence: $M_g - M_i > -0.05 \times (M_r + 16.0) + 0.65$ 78,451
- velocity dispersion > 70 km/s 40,993
- ellipticity: $\epsilon = 1-b/a$
    + b/a from Stokes parameters at some radius
    + b/a from 2D Sersic fit 28,673
        * match with RC3 to see the morphological classicifation: 207 matches <1 arcsec, 17(8%) of which are T = -5 (elliptical).
