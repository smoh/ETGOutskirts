Sample
- parent sample: NYU-VAGC(all galaxies in SDSS with z<0.05) DR6 version 77,149 + 
RC3(galaxeis in SDSS imaging but without spectroscopy) 10,474
- red sequence: luminosity-dependent color cut (includes blue ellipticals) 37,026
    * 32,726 with SDSS spec
- preselect spheroidals:
    * "bulge + disk" model fitting of 1D surface brightness profile
    * B/(B+D) > 0.7 and ellipticity < 0.6
    * "featurelessness": ?
    * velocity dispersion > 70 km/s considering SDSS instrumental dispersion (22,621/32,726)
    * left with 2648
- visual inspection to rule out contaminants including
    * bulge-dominated SB0
    * galaxies with faint dust lanes
    * S0 with weak spiral structure
- final sample: 1923 with velocity dispersion > 70 km/s + 430 without SDSS spec
