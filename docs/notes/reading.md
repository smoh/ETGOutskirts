# Outskirts of Elliptical Galaxies

van der Wel+08
* Galaxy size evolution predicted by hierarchical formation models in LCDM cosmology
    - higher gas fraction in high-z --> more dissipation --> compact --> dry merging/accretion of smaller systems --> strong size evolution
    - strongest for the most massive galaxies
* Observational evidences have been piling up
    - low SFR/high mass (>10^11 Msun) galaxies at z~1.5-2.5 are extremely compact
    - these objects are probably related to present-day ellipticals
* Systematic uncertainties involved (are not enough to account for the strong size evolution)
    - morphological K-corrections[?]
    - surface brightness dimming
    - errors in photometric redshift
    - mass measurements
        + photometric mass: at most a factor of 2-3 uncertainty. based on **reasonable assumptions[?]**. results in the central surface mass density 3 orders of mag larger than present-day
        + kinematical mass: "no detection of absorption lines has been made at z=2"
* Near-by galaxy sample
    - follow Graves+07 - on red sequence/exclude star-forming/include ETG+AGN
    - **Biases in SDSS spectroscopic catalog**
        + compact sources are not targeted because it's a star or it's too bright
        + SDSS measures smaller velocity dispersions for high velocity dispersion (>300 km/s) galaxies - source unknown
* Distant ETGs
    - 0.8 < z < 1.2, compiled from CDF-S, HDF-N, cluster MS 1054-0321(Wuyts+04)
    - Assuming n=4 for all redshifts may introduce systematic errors in case n evolves with redshift[?]
    - To see the average SB profile in the outer part at z=1 is well described by n=4, they stack images/PSFs and fit R^1/n profile with n=3,4,5,6,7.Compare reduced chi-square value which show a difference of 0.2 between n=4,5 and other...
