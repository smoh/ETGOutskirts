  diskbulgefit.pro

  fits an image with a bulge and a disk, the bulge with sersic
  index=bulgeSersic and the disk with sersic index =1
 
  the disk parameters are returned in diskparams, and the bulge
parameters in bulgeparams, the image, and the inverse variance are
passed in via image and iv, the psf FWHM is given by psf, the
chi-squared of the fit is returned by chisquare


 the fits have c=0 (bulge/disky isophotes) and the centers of the
profiles are equal to each other


 todo: add a way to include fractional limits on bulge size
  i.e. as if there were a range of allowed bulge sizes

 FIT_SAMPLE.PRO

 workhorse of fitter, this is what you call to do the fitting
 it writes a file with the output fit parameters. this file will also
include any column from the input file

ARGUMENTS: 
 filename = input FITS file with list of galaxies you want to fit
   this list MUST include the following columns:
   1) NAME unique (string name of object) (for NSA objects use IAU
name)
   2) ATLAS_ID (from NSA catalog)
   3) PARENT_ID (from NSA catalog)
   These are needed by get_imivarpsf.pro, if you use different
data/change the data format, you can change these, but you'll
need to edit get_imivarpsf.pro accordingly
  4) For the profiles you want to fit (if they aren't default
ones, see below), you'll need columns PROFILENAME_FIX and
PROFILENAME_VAL. These contain arrays of 8x(# sersic profiles in fit)
values and provide the initial conditions (and whether parameters are
fixed. See make_input.py for details.

start = index in filename of first galaxy to fit (0 -indexed) this
way you can run multiple instances of the fitter (over condor/pbs)
for the same input galaxy file and then combine the outputs at the end

last = index in filename table of 1+last galaxy to fit (length of
file if everything)

outputdir = directory to put output in. If you want to save the model
images, this needs a subdirectory called models

imagedir = directory where images are. The images have 3 parts, the
image, the inverse variance plane, and the psf. They go in 3 folders,
images, ivar, psf

OPTIONS:
redo = if the input file already includes 'output' columns set this
option (not often used)

residuals = if you want the code to save images of the fitted models
galaxies, set this
 
crop = if you want the code to crop the images before fitting, set
this, you won't want this often. It calls cropimage_2.pro.

profiles = list of profiles you want to fit. If you don't set
this, the code defaults to a sersic profile. If you want the code to
use the input parameters given in the input file, the names used here
have to match what's in the file. profiles should be a
structure, where the keys are the profile names and the values are
the number of parameters (a multiple of 8), for example,
profiles={PROFILE1:16, PROFILE2:16}, would fit 2, 2-component
profiles (using parameters from the input file)
 You can specify default profiles that the code knows and then
you don't need to set the input parameters, the defaults are:
DVC, EXP, SER, DVCEXP

filter='u','g','r',...name of the band you are using (SDSS bands for
NSA)

freesky = set this if you want the sky to be a free parameter

cutoff = set this if you want the models to smoothly go to zero after
4 scalelengths (exponential) 8 scalelengths (dvc or sersic). This is
the typical SDSS behavior. It will slightly change results, so be
consistent

debug = set this if you want the code to print extra information

OUTPUTS: the program writes a file called
outputdir/RAWFITxxx{start}.xxx{last}.fits this file has all the
columns from the input file plus the following:
XCROP, YCROP  - position of left, bottom corner if cropping is used,
                otherwise, 0,0
XLEN, YLEN - size of image fit (smaller than original if cropping)
For each profile fit there are the following columns
FIT_PROFILENAME: final fit parameters for each Sersic component fit
there are 8 parameters (this goes for the input to) they are in this
order (see sersic.pro for formulas)
1) surface brightness at half-light radius
2) half-light radius (refers to semi-major axis)
3) sersic index
4) axis ratio of profile (minor/major)
5) boxiness/diskiness by default I set this to zero, so should you
6) the x coordinate of the central position of the profiles, by
default all components have the same center
7) the y coordinate of the central position
8) the position angle of the component (different components can be
at different angles) in radians (counterclockwise from the x axis)
If the profile to be fit has 2 components, FIT_XXX is a 16-element
array for each galaxy in the list, 
CHISQ_PROFILENAME: reduced chi^2 of fit
COVAR_PROFILENAME: covariance matrix of fit parameters (size of FIT^2)
PERR_PROFILENAME: errors (1-sigma) in fit parameters (same size as FIT_XX)
STAT_PROFILENAME: status of fit, anything other than 0 or 5 is ok
DOF_PROFILENAME: degrees of freedom in fit (#pixels - #parameters in fit)
SKY_PROFILENAME: sky value (0 if sky isn't free)
SKYERR_PROFILENAME: error in sky value (note there are also
covariances one could return
FLUXRATIO_PROFILENAME: flux ratio of first (usually highest sersic
index/smallest component) in a profile to the total flux in the
profile (bulge to total ratio)

if you turn residuals on, then the program also saves a copy of the
best-fit model. It does this to a file outputdir/models/M{NAME}.fits
One file for each galaxy fit. So the profiles in there are in the
order you fit them (you'll have to pay attention)

  sersic.pro

  IDL function that returns a sersic profile
 with the 8 free parameters, givin in this order:
  a_norm      normalization of surface brightness profile
  r_eff       effective radius (in pixels)
  n_sersic    sersic index
  q_ba        ellipticity (minor axis/major axis)
  c_ellip     diskiness/boxiness parameter c=0 for ellipse
              c > 0 for box, c < 0 for disk
  x_0         central position in x
  y_0         central position in y
  phi         rotation angle of major axis


the flux at a point x, y is:

I * exp {-k(n) * [(r / R)^(1/n) - 1]}
r = sqrt{ [ (x-x0)*cos(phi) + (y-y0)*sin(phi) ]^2 + 
    [ ( (y-y0)*cos(phi) - (x-x0)*sin(phi) )/q ]^2 }

where
 k(n) = exp[0.6950-0.1789/n]
I take the functional form for k(n) from Lima Neto, 1999; but any reasonable one should work.
